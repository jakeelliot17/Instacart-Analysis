# Instacart Analysis

**Overview**
In Achievement 4, as part of CareerFoundry's Data Analyst program, I have analyzed Instacart Grocery data using Python. The objective was to learn the ins and outs of Python, writing scripts and creating visuals. The dataset used was open-sourced from Instacart (see below for citation). The goal of the analysis was to glean insights through segmenting the customer base in order to maximize the marketing efforts.
